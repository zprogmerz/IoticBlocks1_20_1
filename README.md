# MDK 1.21.1 ModDevGradle Template

A production-ready NeoForge mod template for **Minecraft 1.21.1** using **ModDevGradle**.

This template starts from the standard MDK structure and adds modern development tooling, including GitHub Actions,
runtime testing, static analysis, automated releases, and dependency management.

    - Client
    - Secondary client
    - Dedicated server
    - GameTest server
    - Data generation
- Centralized mod metadata managed from Gradle
- Mixin and Access Transformer support
- GitHub Actions workflows
    - Build
    - Minecraft runtime testing
    - Qodana static analysis
    - Automated releases

# Quick Start

## 1. Create a repository

Click **Use this template** on GitHub and clone your new repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
```

---

## 2. Configure your mod

Edit the `ModConfig` object in `build.gradle.kts`.

```kotlin
object ModConfig {
    const val MOD_ID = "examplemod"
    const val MOD_NAME = "Example Mod"
    const val MOD_VERSION = "1.0.0"
    ...
}
```

At minimum, update:

- MOD_ID
- MOD_NAME
- MOD_VERSION
- MOD_GROUP_ID
- MOD_DISPLAY_URL
- MOD_AUTHORS
- MOD_DESCRIPTION

---

## 3. Rename the package

Move the example package:

```
src/main/java/io/github/mochi_753/examplemod
```

to your own package.

Also rename:

```
src/main/resources/examplemod.mixins.json
```

to match your new mod ID.

---

## 4. Build

Linux/macOS

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Windows

```bat
gradlew.bat build
```

The compiled JAR will be generated in

```
build/libs
```

---

# Requirements

- Java 21 or newer
- Git

For CI workflows:

- GitHub repository

GitHub Actions currently builds with **Temurin JDK 25** while Minecraft runtime tests use **Java 21**.

# Gradle Tasks

| Task                | Description                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `runClient`         | Launch Minecraft client                           |
| `runClient2`        | Launch a secondary client for multiplayer testing |
| `runServer`         | Launch dedicated server (`--nogui`)               |
| `runGameTestServer` | Launch GameTest server                            |
| `runData`           | Generate data into `src/generated/resources`      |
| `build`             | Build the mod                                     |

---

# Mod Metadata

Most project information is stored in a single place:

```
build.gradle.kts
```

The `generateModMetadata` task generates

```
src/main/templates/META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml
```

automatically, keeping metadata synchronized with Gradle configuration.

---

# GitHub Actions

This template includes four workflows.

| Workflow               | Purpose                                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Build                  | Compile the project and upload artifacts        |
| Minecraft Runtime Test | Verify the built mod loads in Minecraft         |
| Qodana                 | Static code analysis                            |
| Release                | Publish GitHub / CurseForge / Modrinth releases |

---

## Build

Runs on:

- Push
- Pull Request
- Manual dispatch

Steps:

1. Checkout
2. Setup Java
3. Build
4. Upload artifacts

---

## Minecraft Runtime Test

Runs on:

- Pull Requests to `main`
- Manual dispatch

The workflow:

- builds the mod
- stages the built JAR
- launches a headless Minecraft client
- launches a headless Minecraft server

This verifies that the mod can actually load, not just compile.

---

## Qodana

Runs JetBrains Qodana static analysis.

To enable pull request integration, add:

```
QODANA_TOKEN
```

as a repository secret.

---

## Release

Supports:

- Release
- Beta
- Alpha

Optional publishing targets:

- GitHub Releases
- CurseForge
- Modrinth

The workflow automatically:

- builds the project
- generates changelogs with `git-cliff`
- creates version tags
- generates artifact attestations
- publishes releases

---

# Publishing

Set your project IDs inside `ModConfig` in `build.gradle.kts`.

```kotlin
const val CURSEFORGE_PROJECT_ID = "..."
const val MODRINTH_PROJECT_ID = "..."
```

Repository secrets:

| Secret             | Purpose               |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN` | CurseForge publishing |
| `MODRINTH_TOKEN`   | Modrinth publishing   |

### Configuring Dependencies

The release scripts read dependency information from:

* `src/main/templates/dependencies-curseforge.json`
* `src/main/templates/dependencies-modrinth.json`

If your mod has no dependencies, leave the files as an empty JSON array:

```json
[]
```

Otherwise, add your project's dependencies using the appropriate format for each platform.

Example (`dependencies-curseforge.json`):

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "jei", // The slug of the project it depends on.
    "projectID": 238222, // The ID of the project being depended on. Must be a number.
    "type": "requiredDependency" // Dependency type. You can select one of the following: [“embeddedLibrary”, “incompatible”, “optionalDependency”, ‘requiredDependency’, “tool”].
  }
]
```

Example (`dependencies-modrinth.json`):

```json
[
  {
    "version_id": null, // The ID of the version being used. If this is null, it means any version can be used.
    "project_id": "u6dRKJwZ", // The ID of the project being depended on.
    "file_name": null, // I think that's the filename within the dependent project. I'm sorry, I'm not really sure.
    "dependency_type": "required" // Dependency type. You can select one of the following: [“required”, “optional”, “incompatible”, ‘embedded’].
  }
]
```

Replace the example values with the dependencies required by your own mod before publishing.
